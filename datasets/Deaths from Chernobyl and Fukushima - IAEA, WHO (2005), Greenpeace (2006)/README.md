# Deaths from Chernobyl and Fukushima - IAEA, WHO (2005), Greenpeace (2006)

Estimates of the total number of deaths from the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear incidents remain contested: we have therefore included lower and upper estimates to cover the range of considered values.

The number of deaths from Chernobyl are based on direct fatalities from the nuclear incident and radiation exposure in close proximities from IAEA/WHO (2005-06). Lower estimates of deaths across the former USSR and Europe from Fairlie and Sumner (2006); and upper estimates from Greenpeace (2005).

Estimates for Fukushima have been derived from the WHO (2013), and estimated stress-induced deaths in evacuation from the Government of Japan.
