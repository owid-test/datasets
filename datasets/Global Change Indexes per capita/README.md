# Global Change Indexes per capita

Global indexes of change were calculated by OurWorldinData based on available data from various sources. All data represents average per capita figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.

Data was calculated either based on:
(1) sources which originally reported data on a per capita basis, or;
(2) by dividing sources in total absolute terms by UN Population Division estimates of total population. Where figures were based on dividing by population figures, UN estimates were derived from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017).
