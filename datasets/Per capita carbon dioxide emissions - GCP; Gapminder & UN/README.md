# Per capita carbon dioxide emissions - GCP; Gapminder & UN

Per capita carbon dioxide emissions were derived based on total national CO₂ emissions per year from the Global Carbon Project, divided by population figures from Gapminder and the UN.

CO₂ emissions sourced from Le Quéré et al. (2017). Global Carbon Project. Data has been converted from million tonnes of carbon to million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664. Available at: http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/17/data.htm.

Population data based on our combined population series (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-country-gapminder+un); this is based on Gapminder (http://www.gapminder.org/) figures until 1949, and UN thereafter (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/).
