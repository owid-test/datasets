# Time use across activities - OECD Gender data (2018)

Australia, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, China time use estimates are not fully comparable, due to differences in the age of reference. The remaining countries' age of reference are between 15-64.

Note: Data are normalized to 1440 minutes per day. In other words, for those countries for which the time use does not sum up to 1440 minutes, the missing minutes are equally distributed across all activities. 

The survey years also differ amongst the countries included. The second link above includes a breakdown of the minutes spent in sub-activities that make up each of the five activities in this dataset: paid work or study, unpaid work, personal care, leisure, and other (which includes religious/spiritual activities and civic obligations).
