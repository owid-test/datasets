# Cancer deaths and rates indexed to 1990 - OWID based on IHME

The IHME, Global Burden of Disease project publishes estimates of total cancer deaths, death rates (per 100,000 individuals), and age-standardized death rates (which assume a constant and consistent population age structure to compare between countries and with time). 

Our World in Data have indexed these values back to 1990, where deaths and rates in 1990 are assumed to be 100. A value of 120 would therefore indicate a 20% increase since 1990; 70% representing a 30% reduction since 1990.
