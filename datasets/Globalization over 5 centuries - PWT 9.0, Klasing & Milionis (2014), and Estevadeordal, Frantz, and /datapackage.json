Level index derived, and scaled by world GDP levels from Maddison [2001, Table B-18]. The “upper bound” series is then scaled to the benchmark 8 percent European trade-GDP ratio for 1780 due to O’Brien [1982], probably an overstatement of the world trade-GDP ratio. The “lower bound” series is scaled to the benchmark 2 percent world trade-GDP ratio for 1820 due to Maddison [1995, Table 2-4], possibly biased downwards relative to the long-run trend because of the blockades during the Napoleonic Wars.\""
