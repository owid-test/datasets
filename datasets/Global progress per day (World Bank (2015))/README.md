# Global progress per day (World Bank (2015))

Calculations were carried out by Our World in Data based on World Bank, World Development Indicator (WDI) data. This was calculated as the average daily change per metric for any given year based on World Bank statistics on population size, percentage access to development indicators such as electricity, sanitation and improved water, and estimates rates of poverty and child mortality.

From these variables, we calculated the net annual change per year, and divided by 365 to estimate an average daily change.
