# Crop yields by country - FAO (2017)

The FAO calculate average yield data by dividing total crop production (in kilograms or tonnes) by the total area harvested (in hectares).

The FAO report yields in hectagrams per hectare (100g per hectare). Here, we have recalculated these values as tonnes per hectare by dividing by 10,000.

Data from 1961-1991 for Post-Soviet states are assumed to be in line with reported data for the USSR over this period.
