# Land sparing from cereal yields - World Bank (2017)

This dataset has been derived by OWID based on World Bank World Development Indicator (WDI) variables.

The original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was "Land under cereal production (hectares)", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as: "Land under cereal production refers to harvested area, although some countries report only sown or cultivated area. Cereals include wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded."

World/global figures from this World Bank dataset include boundary issues for land under cereal production prior to 1991: this data does not include land within the Former Soviet Union (USSR) and therefore underestimates global land use. To aim to correct for this, we have summed the total land area of production for all countries within the former USSR from 1992, and have added this value to the global total for all years from 1961-1991. Data from 1991 onwards has not been changed.

To derive the land spared from cereal yield increases, we have calculated the area of land which would have been required to maintain global cereal production at actual rates based on the WDI variable "Cereal production (metric tons)". This has been calculated as the area needed to maintain this level of cereal production assuming global average yields had remained constant at 1.42 kilograms per hectares (as reported by the World Development Indicators).
