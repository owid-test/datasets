# Difference in male and female life expectancy - Human Mortality Database

Uses the Human Mortality Database period tables. Following <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018)</a> we plot only those years in which a census was undertaken.

As Goldin and Lleras-Muney (2018) mention: "census data are available every ten years starting in 1841 for England, and every ten years starting in 1860 for Sweden. For France they occurred every 5 years between 1836 and 1936 (except for 1871 which was held in 1872, and for 1916 which was cancelled) and then for 1946, 1962, 1968, 1975, 1982, 1990 and 1999."

Note: the United Kingdom refers to the total population of England and Wales.
