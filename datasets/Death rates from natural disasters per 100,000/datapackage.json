The population interpolated series used here (with sources) is available for download at: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/.\n\nThe data presented here includes all categories classified as \"natural disasters\" (distinguished from technological disasters, such as oil spills and industrial accidents). This includes those from drought, floods, biological epidemics, extreme weather, extreme temperature, landslides, dry mass movements, extraterrestrial impacts, wildfires, volcanic activity and earthquakes.\nThe combined set of \"all natural disasters\" also includes disasters defined as \"insect infestations\", however this has not been included as a discrete dataset due to low impact numbers.",
