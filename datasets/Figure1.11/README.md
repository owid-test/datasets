Where there were breaks in series, such as during World War 2 in Former Soviet Union and South Korea, data has been linearly interpolated to create an annual series for each country.

2011-2015 data (and 2009-2010 for Botsawa) was calculated by splicing Bolt, van Zanden (2013) and 'The 2015 Total Economy Database'. All the other data was taken from Bolt, van Zanden (2013).
