This was calculated by dividing total carbon dioxide figures published by the Global Carbon Project, and long-term GDP figures from the Maddison Project Database.\n\nCO₂ emissions sourced from Le Quéré et al. (2017). Global Carbon Project. Data has been converted from million tonnes of carbon to million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664. Available at: http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/17/data.htm.\n\nReal GDP data was sourced from the Maddison Project Database (version 2018). Measure of real GDP accounts for inflation, i.e. changes in the price level, and this measure is suitable for cross-country income comparisons. \nReference: Maddison Project Database, version 2018.
