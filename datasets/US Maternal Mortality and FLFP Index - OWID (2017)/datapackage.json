The original data shows maternal death per 100,000 live births.\n\nFor more detail see: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality.\nThe index measures maternal mortality as an index to 1900. This was calculated by dividing maternal mortality in each year by maternal mortality in 1900 (therefore 1900 = 100). Values less than 100 indicate a decrease in maternal mortality relative to 1900; values greater than 100 indicate an increase in maternal mortality relative to 1900.",
