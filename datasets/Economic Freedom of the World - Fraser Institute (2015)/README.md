# Economic Freedom of the World - Fraser Institute (2015)

From the 2015 (http://www.freetheworld.com/2015/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2015.pdf) report: The cornerstones of economic freedom are (1) personal choice, (2) voluntary exchange coordinated by markets, (3) freedom to enter and compete in markets, and (4) protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.
Economic freedom is present when individuals are permitted to choose for themselves and engage in voluntary transactions as long as they do not harm the person or property of others.
