# Measures and indicators for Poverty - PovcalNet (World Bank) (2017)

The cost of closing the poverty gap does not take into account costs and inefficiencies from making the necessary transfers.

The cost of closing the poverty gap is calculated as follows: Poverty Gap Index x Poverty Line (1.9 int-$ per day) x 365 x Population.

The poverty gap index for each country corresponds to the estimates available via the option 'Replicate the World Bank's regional aggregation' available in the PovcalNet on-line tool.

The unit of measure is international-$ (2011 PPP), in order to allow cross-country comparisons. This should not be confused with market dollars. 

The poverty gap index estimates from the World Bank's PovcalNet data cover low and middle income countries, with observations every three years in the period 1981-2013. To achieve this level of granularity, the World Bank relies on interpolation for countries in which survey data are not available in particular years, but are available either before or after (or both). The process of interpolation requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the missing year.
