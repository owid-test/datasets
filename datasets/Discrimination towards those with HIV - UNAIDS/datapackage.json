This is measured through population-based surveys (demographic, household surveys and cohort cluster surveys).\n\nTo assess discriminatory attitudes, these studies ask participants a simple yes/no question of \"Would you buy fruits or vegetables from a local market seller if you knew the seller had HIV?\". The given percentage indicates the share of respondents who answered \"no\". Respondents who were unfamiliar on the meaning of HIV were excluded from results of this analysis.",
