# Terrorism injuries - Global Terrorism Database

	The Global Terrorism Database notes that this metric measures:
"The number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators
and victims.
Where there is evidence of injury, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to
be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of
victims injured in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect
only the number of perpetrators who were injured as a result of the incident. Likewise, if
information on the number of perpetrators injured in an attack is missing, but victim
injured are known, this field will only report the number of victims injured in the
incident."
