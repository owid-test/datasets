# Supply chain loss of calories - FAO (2017)

This data was calculated by OurWorldinData based on UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) datasets.

Total calories lost through the supply chain were calculated by multiplying FAO figures on losses (within its Food Balance Sheets), measured in thousand tonnes per year, by average commodity-specific nutritional factors as published by the FAO.

For example, the total caloric losses of wheat was derived by multiplying each country's wheat losses (in thousand tonnes) by caloric density of wheat (measured in kcal per 100 grams). Combining caloric losses for each commodity gives the total losses across all commodity types.

The average caloric supply chain loss per person per day were derived by dividing total caloric losses by a country's total population, and by 365.
