# Terrorism incidents - Global Terrorism Database


	The Global Terrorism Database clarifies its definition of terrorism as:
"The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by
a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion,
or intimidation.
In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD,
all three of the following attributes must be present:
- The incident must be intentional â€“ the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a
perpetrator.
- The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including
property violence, as well as violence against people.

- The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not
include acts of state terrorism."
