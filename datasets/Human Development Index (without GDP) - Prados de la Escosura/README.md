# Human Development Index (without GDP) - Prados de la Escosura

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic (index) that measures key dimensions of human development:
- life expectancy
- literacy
- educational enrolment
â€“ and per capita gross domestic product (GDP)

This particular metric presents the assessed HDI normalised without the variable of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), so includes life expectancy, literacy and schooling rates only.
