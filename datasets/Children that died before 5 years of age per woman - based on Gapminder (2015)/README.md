# Children that died before 5 years of age per woman - based on Gapminder (2015)

Child mortality is the probability that a child born in a specific year will die before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates.
Child mortality was multiplied by fertility to obtain the data on how many children died on average per woman.
