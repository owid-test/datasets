  "description": "Population index was derived by OurWorldinData based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).\r\n\r\nThe population index measures total population (all ages and genders) as an index to population in 1961. This index was calculated by dividing population values in any given year by population in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in population vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.\r\nThe original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was \"Population, total\", which is defined by the World Bank/UN as: \"Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values shown are midyear estimates.\"\r\nData available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators [accessed 19th July 2017]",
