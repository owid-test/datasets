Global exposure to PM2.5 is then systematically estimated based on blocks or grid cells covering 0.1째 x 0.1째 of longitude and latitude (approximately 11 km x 11 km at the equator).\r\n\r\nTaking into account the population in each block within a country, this data is then aggregated as estimated exposure concentrations to national-level population-weighted averages for a given year.",
