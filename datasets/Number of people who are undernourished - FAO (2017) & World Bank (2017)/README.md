# Number of people who are undernourished - FAO (2017) & World Bank (2017)

The number of people who are undernourished was derived by combining several datasets: the prevalence of undernourishment (%) from World Bank, World Development Indicators and the UN FAO State of Food Insecurity 2017; and global population figures utilised by the UN FAO database. Multiplying these figures allow for the calculation of the absolute number of people undernourished.

The number of people with sufficient caloric intake (i.e. not undernourished) was calculated as the difference between total population and number of people undernourished.
